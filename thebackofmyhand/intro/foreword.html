			<p>
			I recall a moment in my childhood, <br>
			or many moments, <br>
			when I stared at myself in the mirror.<br>
			I held my hands up, palms forward,<br>
			to remind myself of my humanity.

			To clarify, it is not inhuman to be brown, <br>
			but it certainly felt that way sometimes.

				Lastly, I have never experienced overt racism. <br>
				Recognizing this, I can never imagine how inhuman <br>
				how others feel in such hostile environments.
