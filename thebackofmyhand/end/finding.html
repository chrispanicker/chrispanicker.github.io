			<h2>Finding</h2>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				I’ve searched,<br>
				I’ve rambled,<br>
				I’ve conversed.<br>
				So what have I found?

			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				I’ve ignored my skin, <br>
				Or stared at it like a stranger.<br>
				But now I'm starting to find myself,<br>
				Skin and all. <br>
				It was with me before<br> 
				I became uncomfortable with it.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<p>
				Searching, rambling, conversing.<br>
				This is not a comprehensive list.<br>
				I will forever continue to come to terms with, <br>
				and learn more about my skin.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				But this is my one finding.<br>
				After years of ignoring it,<br>
				I see it. <br>
				My skin doesn’t sit idly, <br>
				Muffled by my efforts.<br>
				It speaks,
				and I speak with it now.<br>
				We have a lot to catch up on.
