	<p>The back of my hand. Is this me? Does the composition of my self begin and end here? I am not the back of my hand. If you cut it off, is that severed hand “Chris?” I don’t know who I am or where I begin and end. I wonder if this is a byproduct of being in my twenties... I guess I am who I am. I didn't have to ask questions of myself as a kid. You ask 6 year old Chris who he is and he’d say “Chris.” That’s who he is. A bit of experience later, that simple truth hasn't changed. I may answer the question a little differently and a bit long-winded but I am still Chris. I am not the back of my hand, but it is something that is a part of me, and my awareness of this fact will never change me from being Chris. I think this is the same for everyone. The nuances that make you up develop with the abstraction of self. I am not just here, I am here because of the things that brought me here. I am not here, I am here because of the experiences I had in the past. <br><br>

    Don't reduce me to my genes, I am Indian in the genetic sense, I am American in the colloquial sense. This is the plea of the second-generation. I find myself torn between cultures and how to define the term. When I was young, I looked at myself with my palms forward. “I’m no different if you look at me from this side…” It took me a long time to turn my hands around and face the back of my hand. I didn’t know the back of my hand, I only knew the front. <br><br>

    Are the nuances of my upbringing what make up my culture? I never learned the language of my ancestors, in the literal and metaphorical sense. I don’t know the life my parents lived in India, I don’t know how my grandparents feel in America. I saw myself as different from them. My culture told me that I understood the world better than them, I grew up here, so I knew my world more than they ever could. But this was my world, not theirs. They had their own understandings, and made the world they needed it to be. They adapted, but I never had to.<br><br>

    Who do I wake up as? Who am I today? I see myself wholly, but there are things in my periphery that I hide just out of view. My brown-ness stares you in the face, but when I see myself, I don’t see it. I see crooked teeth, messy hair, tired eyes. I don’t know if this is because I am comfortable with my skin, or if I’ve been turning a blind (tired) eye to it. 
    What do I appropriate? I felt like my skin was an appropriation of something I didn't know. It wasn’t me, so why do I have to live with it? Maybe it's ungrateful to say that. I do have a limited perspective, and my skin is more than just a jacket for my muscles and tendons. There is a cultural undertone to the color of my skin, I can’t/shouldn’t want to escape that. It’s not like it’s possible to. I feel like I’ve been in a bit of an identity crisis, and this project automatically admits that, but I, and every other brown person has to come to terms with it one way or another. <br><br>

    Skin is such a fundamental aspect of the human experience. Skin doesn’t dictate anything on its own, but it does seem to dictate a lot. It gives me names. It tells you a part of who I am. You don’t have to speak to me to predetermine who I am to you. I would prefer that you speak to me, but I get it I guess. I think a lot of my formative years were based around the ideas of surprising people if they do end up speaking to me. I wanted the answer to be “No” to anything you might expect. I specifically avoided being interested in the medical field, programming, and any other stereotype I heard too much of. I think this was a part of the general childhood fear of not being unique, and trying to find any aspect of my character for people to latch onto. And thus, I was an artist. I doodled, I played music, I wanted to engage my creative brain as much as possible to escape any connection to the “smart indian kid.”<br><br>

     There were some things I couldn’t escape. I enjoyed video games, I currently enjoy coding, but I think I’ve come to terms with those things as a creative, and I think I see them as a sort of comfort food.</p>
