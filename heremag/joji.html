			<h3>JOJI IS FILTHY FRANK</h3><br>
			<p>This is old news to many people at this point, but I think the conversation is still worth having. Filthy Frank was a controversial youtube channel that was active in the 2010's, and has 7 million followers to this day. The content mostly consisted of music videos and sketches, with racist, mysogynistic, and generally ignorant scripts. Joji has spoken out about the channel, saying that, "Filthy Frank is the embodiment of everything a person should not be. He is anti-PC, anti-social, and anti-couth.  He behaves and reacts excessively to everything expressly to highlight the ridiculousness of racism, misogyny, legalism, injustice, ignorance and other social blights. He also sets an example to show how easy it is in the social media for any zany material to gain traction/followings by simply sharing unsavoury opinions and joking about topics many find offensive."
				<br><br>
			The question is whether or not the awareness or even satirical nature of the character is enough to justify the actions and words of Joji. There's no avoiding the fact that he chose to create the character and say what is said in the sketches.</p>
