			<h3>WHAT WAS YOUR INSPIRATION FOR HOT AND HEAVY?</h3><br>
			<p>So much of life is submitting to change and saying goodbye even if you don’t want to. Now, whenever I go to places that used to be significant to me, it feels like trespassing the past. I know that the teen version of me wouldn’t approve of me now, and that’s embarrassing and a little bit heartbreaking, even if I know intellectually that I like my life and who I am.</p>

			<h3>WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT PROCESS FOR THE HOT AND HEAVY MUSIC VIDEO?</h3><br>
			<p>I wanted to visualize the moment when you first reflect on your childhood, which I think can also be the moment that childhood is over, for me, I feel like there was a hard switch when I started releasing music, when my identity went from being a personal project to something publicly observed and reflected. I asked my family—shoutout to my grandma—and some of my closest friends to be extras because they’re the people that knew me before that switch.</p>
